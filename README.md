# Algorithm Solutions

This repository contains solutions to various algorithm problems categorized by different topics such as arrays, hashing, backtracking, binary search, binary trees, graphs, linked lists, prefix sum, sliding window, stack, and two-pointer techniques.

## Directory Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `arrays_hashing/`
- `backtracking/`
- `binary_search/`
- `binary_trees/`
- `graphs/`
- `linked_list/`
- `prefix_sum/`
- `stack/`
- `two_pointer/`

## How to Use

Each file contains a solution to a specific problem. The problem description, input, and output examples are provided in the comments at the top of each file. The solutions are implemented as methods within a `Solution` class.
